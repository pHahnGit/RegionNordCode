# RegionNordCode
Code Challenge for first interview Region Nord.

This was a quick code challenge done for a job interview.
The StarWars API challenge was particulary interesting, as I came across some considerations regarding cacheing and how to handle the list objects, which I did not have time for.
Hence I did some more work on it to hone my skills.
##TODO:
- ~~Caching of API request as keys instead of ID's~~
- ~~Turn list of associated URL's into list of objects~~
- Generate a full objects and shallow for the associated objects, in order to not work through the entire associations of the objects when doing HTTP request.
